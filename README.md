## Desrption
A problem that consumers often face concerns how much a pizza actually costs. Comparing the unit prices of different pizzas is not easy. 
With the help of the "Pizza price" mobile app, you can easily compare the cost-effectiveness of different pizzas. All you need to do is enter data such as the diameter and the price for the entire pizza and the app will show you which pizza is the most cost-effective. 
The app remembers the units of measurement and currency selected by the user.
